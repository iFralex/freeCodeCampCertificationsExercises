## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from freeCodeCamp served as my gateway into the heart of web development. This certification equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript, encompassing fundamental concepts like variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

Having fortified my foundation in JavaScript, I embarked on a journey that involved crafting algorithms to manipulate strings, calculating factorials, and even simulating the orbit of the International Space Station. Along the way, I delved into two pivotal programming paradigms: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP), expanding my horizons as a developer.
